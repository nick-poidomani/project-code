          <p>The Plant Monitoring System is a low cost, high efficiency and portable device used to collect and store information about the conditions within the device that may have an affect on the plant's health. The device will automatically switch between wall power and a 9V battery. It also utilizes a variety of sensors including: temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light. The data collected on the device will be transmited via bluetooth to a file on a PC that can be opened using our supporting software. This supporting software will give options to graph the different readings over the duration of the monitoring cycle.</p>
